# ML-1-project
First project for Machine Learning
This is my first project using my knowledge of machine learning. This project uses three datasets, 
and I have used only 2 for the time being. It uses and implements basic ml functions in scikit learn,
such as `score()`, `accuracy_score()` and `predict()` for checking how the model works.

P.S. : This project will be continuously updated, it is far from finished. Since it is unfinished, I shall
explain the aims and objectives of this project after it is complete.
